Personal Website project for CS1520

Website has a main page with three subpages. The subpages have a description and a log but no articles yet.
The nav bar consists of the three categories with the background images. The background for each of the pages
is ascii art that I made. There is a home button on the top of each page that takes you back to the home page.
